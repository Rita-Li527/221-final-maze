# Lee Algorithm Implementation
## Rita Li and Sam Ding

In this project, we implemented the Lee algorithm. Lee algorithm is based on Breadth-first Search (BFS) and provides one possible solution for the common maze routing problem.

## Composition
The package Maze contains four classes: Cell, Node, Lee, and Maze.


### Cell
This class stores the x and y coordinates.

### Node
This class stores the Cell, which contains the x and y coordinates, and the status of each Cell.

### Lee
This class implements the Lee algorithm. 

### Maze
This class contains the main function that takes in a 20x20 matrix and computes the optimal/shortest path available from the start to the finish.
